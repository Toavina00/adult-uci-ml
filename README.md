# Census Income

## Description
We want to determine whether a person makes over \\$50,000 a year based on census data. This is a classification problem where we aim to categorize individuals into two groups: those with an income exceeding \\$50,000 annually and those with an income below this threshold. Given that we have a classification task, a machine learning algorithm can be applied to the problem.

To achieve this, we will analyze the "Census Income" dataset containing various features and by leveraging them, we can train a machine learning model to make accurate classifications. This classification task can be useful for applications such as targeted marketing, economic research, and policy-making.

Once the model is trained, we will evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. These metrics will help us ensure that our model is reliable and effective in distinguishing between the two income groups.


## Dataset

- Summary: Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database.  A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0)).
